What Is DNS?

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the phonebook of the internet.

* Humans use domain names: www.google.com
* Computers use IP addresses: 142.250.190.68

DNS translates domain names → IP addresses, so your browser knows which server to talk to.

⚙️ Step-by-Step: How DNS Works

Let’s take the example:
You type https://www.example.com in your browser.

---

🧩 Step 1: Check Browser Cache

Your browser first checks if it already knows the IP address for www.example.com.
If found (recently visited), it uses it directly — fastest path.

If not → go to the next step.

---

🧠 Step 2: Check OS Cache

Your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) maintains its own DNS cache.
If found there → returned immediately.

If not → next step.

---

🌍 Step 3: Check Local Resolver (Usually Your ISP or Router)

Your device’s DNS resolver (configured in network settings or Wi-Fi) is contacted.
Your device is given a DNS server IP by your network (DHCP).
It could be:

* Your router’s DNS forwarder
* Or an external DNS like:

  * Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
  * Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1)
  * ISP’s own DNS server

If the resolver already knows the IP → it returns it.
If not → it begins the recursive DNS lookup.

---

🔁 Step 4: Recursive DNS Lookup (The Core Process)

Here’s how it unfolds:

(1) Root DNS Server

* Resolver asks a Root Server:

  > “Hey, where can I find info for .com domains?”

Root servers don’t know exact IPs — they return the Top-Level Domain (TLD) server’s address (for .com in this case).

There are 13 logical root servers worldwide (named A to M), each with hundreds of actual replicas.

---

(2) TLD DNS Server

The resolver then asks the .com TLD server:

> “Where can I find info for example.com?”

TLD server replies with the Authoritative DNS server for example.com.

---

(3) Authoritative DNS Server

Now the resolver asks that authoritative server:

> “What is the IP of www.example.com?”

The authoritative server responds:

> www.example.com → 93.184.216.34

✅ That’s the final IP.

---

🧱 Step 5: Response Is Cached

* Resolver caches the result (for a duration defined by TTL — Time To Live).
* Your OS and browser also cache it.
* Next time you or anyone nearby visits the same site → lookup is much faster.

---

🔄 Full Flow Summary


Browser → OS Cache → Local Resolver
→ Root Server
→ TLD Server (.com)
→ Authoritative Server (example.com)
→ Returns IP Address
→ Cache → HTTP Request Begins


---

🕒 Typical Latency

* Cached DNS: <1 ms
* Fresh DNS lookup: ~20–120 ms depending on network + resolver

That’s why CDNs (like Cloudflare, Akamai) place DNS resolvers close to users — to make it fast.

🧭 Example in Action

If you ping:


ping google.com


You’ll see something like:


Pinging google.com [142.250.190.68]


That IP came from your DNS resolver.

🧩 Types of DNS Records

Each domain can have multiple records, each serving a different purpose:

| Record Type | Description                                   | Example                                            |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| A       | IPv4 address                                  | example.com → 93.184.216.34                      |
| AAAA    | IPv6 address                                  | example.com → 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946 |
| CNAME   | Alias (points to another domain)              | www → example.com                                |
| MX      | Mail exchange server                          | example.com → mail.example.com                   |
| TXT     | Text info (often for verification, SPF, DKIM) | v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com                   |
| NS      | Nameserver records                            | ns1.exampledns.com                               |
| PTR     | Reverse DNS lookup (IP → domain)              | 93.184.216.34 → example.com                      |

🧠 Real-World Insight

* CDNs use smart DNS routing to direct you to the nearest server for speed.
  (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly)
* Load balancers can change DNS records dynamically.
* DNS misconfigurations are a common cause of downtime.
* DNS propagation (when you change DNS) can take hours worldwide due to caching.
