Cache-Control– Short & Sweet 

| What?| HTTP header that controls caching(browser, CDN, proxy). |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Who sets it?| Server(in response). Client can *suggest* via Cache-Control: max-age=0 (force revalidate), but server decides. |
| Where?| In HTTP Response Headers(not request, usually). |

Key Directives (Most Used)

| Directive | Meaning |
|-----------------|--------|
| no-cache        | Don’t use stale cache; revalidatewith server every time. |
| no-store        | Never cache(sensitive data). |
| public          | Anyone (browser, CDN) can cache. |
| private         | Only browsercan cache (not CDN). |
| max-age=3600    | Cache for 1 hour(in seconds). (Both CDN, browser) |
| must-revalidate | Once stale, must checkwith server. |

Example Response

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400, must-revalidate


→ Browser & CDN can cache this for 24 hours.  
After 24h, must ask server: “Still fresh?”

Use? 
Speed + Save Bandwidth 
- First load: Download from server  
- Next loads (within max-age): Instant from cache 
- Huge for images, CSS, JS, APIs

Pro Tip for FE Devs
html
<!-- Force no cache (dev only) -->
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store">

Or in JS:
js
fetch('/api/data', { cache: 'no-store' })  // Bypass cache


---

TL;DR:  
Server sets Cache-Control in response→ tells browser/CDN how long to keep stuff.  
Use it to make your site FAST.
