HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Now the important part:
Do we need a new TCP handshake for the next request?

It depends on the HTTP version:

---

HTTP/1.0

* Each request → new TCP connection.
* Inefficient, since handshake happens every time.
* Example: loading a page with 10 images = 10 TCP handshakes 😩

---

HTTP/1.1

* Introduced persistent connections (a.k.a. *keep-alive*).
* After the first handshake, the TCP connection stays open for multiple requests/responses.
* The server can reuse the same connection for subsequent resources like CSS, JS, images.

✅ So for example:


GET /index.html
GET /style.css
GET /app.js


All can reuse the same TCP connection (as long as the server supports keep-alive).

---

HTTP/2

* Big upgrade. Uses a single TCP connection for multiple parallel streams.
* Multiple requests and responses can flow simultaneously through one connection.
* Greatly improves performance.

✅ So: Only one TCP handshake per origin (like `example.com`), and all assets are multiplexed over it.

---

HTTP/3 (QUIC)

* Uses UDP instead of TCP.
* Removes handshake latency altogether.
* Even faster connection setup and better performance on mobile networks.

⚙️ Summary:

| HTTP Version  | TCP Handshake per Request? | Persistent Connection | Multiplexing |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| HTTP/1.0      | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                  | ❌ No         |
| HTTP/1.1      | ❌ Usually not              | ✅ Yes (keep-alive)    | ❌ No         |
| HTTP/2        | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes        |
| HTTP/3 (QUIC) | ❌ No (uses UDP)            | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes        |
