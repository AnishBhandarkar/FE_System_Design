HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Now the important part:
Do we need a new TCP handshake for the next request?

It depends on the HTTP version:

---

HTTP/1.0

* Each request → new TCP connection.
* Inefficient, since handshake happens every time.
* Example: loading a page with 10 images = 10 TCP handshakes 😩

---

HTTP/1.1

* Introduced persistent connections (a.k.a. *keep-alive*).
* After the first handshake, the TCP connection stays open for multiple requests/responses.
* The server can reuse the same connection for subsequent resources like CSS, JS, images.

✅ So for example:


GET /index.html
GET /style.css
GET /app.js


All can reuse the same TCP connection (as long as the server supports keep-alive).

- In HTTP/1.1, requests are handled sequentially over a single TCP connection. Even though it introduced "persistent connections" (keeping the connection open for multiple requests), it still followed a strict "stop-and-wait" model.
- The Workflow: The browser sends Request A and must wait for Response A to finish completely before it can send Request B.

HTTP/2

* Big upgrade. Uses a single TCP connection for multiple parallel streams.
* Multiple requests and responses can flow simultaneously through one connection.
* Greatly improves performance.

✅ So: Only one TCP handshake per origin (like `example.com`), and all assets are multiplexed over it.

A Small Nuance: TCP Head-of-Line Blocking
While HTTP/2 solved the Application-level blocking (one request blocking another) [Which was in Http1.1], it is still built on top of TCP. If a single packet is lost in the network, TCP stops everything until that packet is retransmitted. This is known as TCP Head-of-Line blocking.

This is actually why HTTP/3 was created—it moves from TCP to a protocol called QUIC (built on UDP) to ensure that one lost packet doesn't stop all other parallel streams!

HTTP/3 (QUIC)

* Uses UDP instead of TCP.
* Removes handshake latency altogether.
* Even faster connection setup and better performance on mobile networks.

⚙️ Summary:

| HTTP Version  | TCP Handshake per Request? | Persistent Connection | Multiplexing |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| HTTP/1.0      | ✅ Yes                      | ❌ No                  | ❌ No         |
| HTTP/1.1      | ❌ Usually not              | ✅ Yes (keep-alive)    | ❌ No         |
| HTTP/2        | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes        |
| HTTP/3 (QUIC) | ❌ No (uses UDP)            | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes        |
