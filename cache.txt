I am preparing for Frontend System Design interviews at top tech companies. I will ask you about specific frontend concepts one by one

For each concept I provide, give me a comprehensive, structured, and professional response optimized for interview preparation. Structure your response exactly as follows:

1. **Concept Overview**
   - Clearly define what the concept is.
   - Explain why it matters in modern frontend applications, especially at scale.
   - Provide a real-world use case or example (e.g., where companies like Google, Twitter/X, Netflix use it).

2. **How It Works (Technical Deep Dive)**
   - Explain the underlying mechanism in detail
   - Compare it with alternatives if relevant
   - Include key advantages and limitations.

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Show a high-level code example (React/TypeScript preferred, but framework-agnostic is fine if better). (server-express)
   - Highlight best practices and common patterns.
   - Mention browser APIs, libraries, or tools commonly used

4. **Interview-Relevant Challenges & Edge Cases**
   - Discuss common pitfalls or gotchas
   - Explain how to handle them robustly.
   - Cover scalability, performance, and security implications.

5. **Trade-offs & When to Use**
   - When should you choose this over alternatives?
   - When should you avoid it?
   - Key trade-offs (performance, complexity, browser support, security).

6. **Common Interview Follow-up Questions**
   - List 6–8 realistic follow-up questions an interviewer might ask about this concept.
   - For each, provide a concise key point or suggested answer direction.

7. **Professional Resources**
   - Recommend 4–6 high-quality resources to deepen understanding:
     – Official documentation (MDN, WHATWG, etc.)
     – In-depth articles from reputable sources (e.g., Google Web Fundamentals, Jake Archibald, Addy Osmani, Kent C. Dodds)
     – Videos (Frontend Masters, YouTube channels like Fireship, ByteByteGo)
     – GitHub repos or specs if relevant

Keep the explanation detailed yet concise, using bullet points, code snippets (in TypeScript/React where applicable), and clear subheadings. Use analogies when helpful for intuition.
