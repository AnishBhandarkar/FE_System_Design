1. Defining the Landscape

> In an interview, distinguish between these three terms to show depth:

* Regulation: Legally binding rules set by governments (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). Non-compliance leads to heavy fines.

* Compliance: The act of meeting those regulatory requirements or internal policies.

* Standards: Best practices or frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, WCAG) that help you achieve compliance but aren't always "laws" themselves.

> Why it matters for FE:
The Front-End is the entry point for data collection. If your UI captures a user's health data or credit card without proper consent or encryption, the system is compromised before the data even reaches the database.

2. Major Frameworks (The "Big Five")

| Framework      | Focus                 | Key FE Implication |
| ---------------| --------------------- | --- |
| GDPR (EU)      | Data Privacy & Rights | Consent banners, Right to Erasure, Data Portability. |
| CCPA/CPRA (CA) | Consumer Privacy      | "Do Not Sell My Info" links, transparency of data usage. |
| HIPAA (US)     | Health Data (PHI)     | Session timeouts, automatic logout, no PHI in URLs/Logs. |
| PCI-DSS        | Payment Info          | Never touch raw card data; use iFrames (Stripe Elements). |
| WCAG 2.1       | Accessibility         | Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigability. |

3. Data Protection & Privacy in the UI

- In system design, you must categorize data:
* PII (Personally Identifiable Information): Email, Name, IP Address.
* Sensitive PII: SSN, Medical records, Biometrics.

- Consent Management:
* Opt-in (GDPR): Tracking/Cookies must be disabled by default until the user clicks "Accept."
* Opt-out (CCPA): Tracking can be on, but a clear "Stop" mechanism must exist.

- Data Minimization:
Design your forms to only ask for what is strictly necessary. Example: Don't ask for a full Date of Birth if you only need to verify the user is over 18.

4. Front-End Technical Implications

Secure Data Handling:
* Storage: Avoid storing PII in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` as they are vulnerable to XSS. Use HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies for sensitive tokens.

* Transmission: Ensure all forms use POST (never GET) for sensitive data to keep it out of browser history and server logs.

Privacy-Friendly Analytics:
If the interviewer asks about tracking, suggest Server-side Tagging. Instead of the FE sending data directly to Google Analytics, it sends it to your own proxy server which strips PII before forwarding it.

5. Security Requirements for Compliance

1. Transport Layer: HTTPS is a baseline. For high-compliance, implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) to prevent protocol downgrade attacks.

2. Encryption: * In Transit: TLS 1.2+.
* At Rest: (Usually BE) but FE must ensure data is encrypted before being cached in Service Workers.

3. Audit Trails: Every "Admin" action in the FE (e.g., deleting a user) should trigger an audit log entry on the backend containing the `who`, `what`, and `when`.

---

6. Reporting and Monitoring

Compliance isn't "set and forget."

* Breach Notification: GDPR requires reporting within 72 hours. Your system needs Real-time Monitoring (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) to detect unusual spikes in data access.

* Incident Response: As an FE engineer, you must ensure your error logs do not contain sensitive data that could be leaked during a breach investigation.

---

7. Third-Party Services

Most modern systems use "Component-based compliance":

* Auth: Use Auth0 or Firebase (they handle the heavy lifting of secure storage).

* Payments: Use Stripe or Braintree. They provide hosted iFrames or "Fields" so the raw credit card data never touches your FE code, moving you out of the strictest PCI-DSS scope.

* Vendor Risk: Always check the SOC2 Type II report of any vendor you integrate into your FE.

8. Compliance in System Design Interviews

How to discuss trade-offs:

* Performance vs. Compliance: Consent banners and heavy tracking scripts can hurt LCP (Largest Contentful Paint). Suggest Asynchronous Loading of compliance scripts.

* UX vs. Security: Frequent session timeouts (HIPAA) annoy users. Suggest Graceful Re-authentication (showing a modal instead of a full redirect).

Scenario: Design a Health Dashboard:
> "To comply with HIPAA, I would implement an Inactivity Timer in the FE. I would ensure no PHI is stored in `localStorage`. I'd also use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent unauthorized third-party scripts from reading the sensitive health data rendered on the screen."

9. Common Pitfalls & Misconceptions

* "Compliance is a Backend problem": False. The FE handles input validation, consent, and session management.

* "GDPR is EU-only": False. It applies to any company globally that processes the data of EU residents.

* "HTTPS is enough": False. HTTPS protects data in transit, but does nothing for data privacy (how you use the data) or accessibility.
