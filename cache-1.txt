### Enhanced Prompt (Ready to Use)

> I am preparing for Front-End system design interviews.
> I want to deeply understand **HTTPS** from a **system design and real-world implementation perspective**.
>
> Please explain HTTPS in a **structured, interview-oriented way**, covering **all major and minor concepts** that a Front-End or Full-Stack engineer is expected to know.
>
> Specifically, cover:
>
> 1. **What HTTPS is and why it exists**
>
>    * Problems with HTTP
>    * Security goals (confidentiality, integrity, authentication)
> 2. **How HTTPS works internally**
>
>    * TLS/SSL handshake step-by-step
>    * Symmetric vs asymmetric encryption
>    * Certificates, Certificate Authorities (CA), and trust chain
>    * Key exchange and session keys
> 3. **HTTPS request–response lifecycle**
>
>    * From browser URL entry to receiving the response
>    * DNS, TCP, TLS, and HTTP layers
> 4. **Performance considerations**
>
>    * TLS handshake cost
>    * Session resumption
>    * HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 impact
>    * CDN + HTTPS optimization

> 5. **Certificates in practice**
>
>    * Types of certificates (DV, OV, EV)
>    * Wildcard certificates
>    * Certificate renewal & expiration
>    * Self-signed vs trusted certificates
> 6. **HTTPS in system design interviews**
>
>    * When and why HTTPS is mandatory
>    * Common interview questions
>    * Design trade-offs and real-world scenarios
>    * How to explain HTTPS clearly in an interview
> 7. **Common misconceptions & pitfalls**
>
>    * HTTPS vs encryption of data at rest
>    * HTTPS does NOT prevent all attacks
>
> Use **clear explanations**, **simple diagrams (ASCII if helpful)**, and **real-world examples**.
> Assume I have **basic web knowledge but want deep clarity** for interviews.
