> I am preparing for **Front-End system design interviews** and want to deeply understand **Compliance & Regulation** from both a **system design and production perspective**.
>
> Please explain **Compliance & Regulation** in a **structured, interview-oriented manner**, covering all key concepts that a Front-End or Full-Stack engineer should know.
>
> Specifically, cover:
>
> 1. **What compliance and regulation mean**
>
>    * Difference between compliance, regulation, and standards
>    * Why they matter for web applications and FE systems
>    * Legal, financial, medical, and reputational consequences of non-compliance
> 2. **Major compliance frameworks and regulations relevant to FE**
>
>    * GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
>    * CCPA/CPRA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
>    * HIPAA (for health-related applications)
>    * PCI-DSS (for payment processing)
>    * Accessibility standards (WCAG, ADA)
> 3. **Data protection and privacy**
>
>    * Personal data vs sensitive data
>    * Consent management for FE apps
>    * Data minimization principles
>    * Cookie and local storage considerations under regulations
> 4. **Front-End implications**
>
>    * Collecting, storing, and transmitting data securely
>    * Privacy-friendly analytics
>    * Cookie banners, opt-in vs opt-out mechanisms
>    * Secure handling of user input to comply with regulations
> 5. **Security requirements driven by compliance**
>
>    * HTTPS / TLS as a compliance requirement
>    * Encryption at rest and in transit
>    * Authentication and access control
>    * Logging and audit trails
> 6. **Regulatory reporting and monitoring**
>
>    * Breach notification timelines (e.g., GDPR: 72 hours)
>    * FE responsibilities in incident reporting
>    * Monitoring and audit readiness
> 7. **Third-party services and compliance**
>
>    * Cloud providers (AWS, Firebase) and regulatory responsibilities
>    * Using third-party analytics, payment, and authentication services securely
>    * Vendor risk management
> 8. **Compliance in system design interviews**
>
>    * How to discuss compliance trade-offs in FE architecture
>    * Real-world examples and scenarios
>    * How to design FE systems to minimize regulatory risk
> 9. **Common pitfalls and misconceptions**
>
>    * “Compliance is only a back-end problem”
>    * “GDPR only applies in Europe”
>    * “Using HTTPS alone solves all compliance issues”
>
> Use **clear explanations**, **real-world examples**, **interview-friendly summaries**, and **ASCII diagrams if needed**.
> Assume I have **basic FE knowledge but want deep clarity for system design interviews**.
