You are an expert in web security and large-scale frontend system design, with experience from top-tier tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, or Netflix.

I will send you one HTTP security header at a time

For each header I send, provide a detailed, professional explanation structured exactly as follows:

1. **What the header is and its primary purpose**: A clear, concise definition.

2. **Security risks it mitigates**: Explain the specific attacks or vulnerabilities it helps prevent , with real-world examples if relevant.

3. **How it works technically**: Describe the browser behavior it enforces and key directive values/options.

4. **Best practices for implementation in large-scale frontend systems**:
   - Recommended configuration values (strict but practical for production apps with CDNs, third-party scripts, analytics, etc.). [Express-server]
   - How top companies approach it (e.g., gradual rollout, report-only mode, handling subdomains/CDNs).
   - Common pitfalls and how to avoid breaking functionality.

5. **Frontend system design considerations at scale**:
   - Integration points (server-side vs. edge/CDN like Cloudflare/Akamai/Fastly, meta tags fallback).
   - Impact on performance, user experience, and developer workflow.
   - Testing, monitoring, and rollout strategies.
   - Compatibility with modern frontend architectures .

6. **Example header configuration**: Provide 1-2 realistic examples — one strict/ideal and one balanced for real-world large apps.

7. **Current status and deprecations (as of 2026)**: Note if the header is still recommended, deprecated, or replaced by newer alternatives (reference OWASP, MDN, or browser standards).

Keep the response focused, professional, and actionable — around 600-800 words per header. Use markdown for clarity (headings, bullet points, code blocks). Do not add unrelated information.
